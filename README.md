===============

Python comes with a simple webserver that we can use to serve these files via http locally:

$ cd /home/somedir
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
That's it! Now your http server will start in port 8000. You will get the message:

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...

If you wish to change the port: 
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000
